Charging by the hour is one of the most common ways to invoice a client. Some companies or clients specify the time tracking tool to use, though it usually won't fit your own workflows. This even gets more complicated and cumbersome, when the invoices should contain the tasks you spent time on.

Minutes is a CLI tool, primarily made for entrepreneurs and finance people, to help their daily work by synchronizing worklogs from a `source` to a `target` software. The `source` can be your own time tracking tool you use, let's say [Tempo](https://tempo.io/), while the `target` is a bookkeeping software, like [Zoho Books](https://books.zoho.com).

## Key features

_Some features may vary depending on the `source` and `target`. For more information, please refer to their documentation._

- Customize the date time format used for fetching entries
- Set a specific start and end date to query entries
- Force every second spent to be billable[^1]
- Treat tags attached to an entry as tasks you spent time on[^2]
- Round billable and unbillable seconds to the closest minute per entry[^3]
- Customizable table output before uploading

[^1]: It can be useful if the `source` does not support billable time, while the `target` does.
[^2]: When you need to split time across entries or your `source` tool does not support tasks, it comes handy to tag entries.
[^3]: Rounding rules are the following: if you spent >=30 seconds on a task, it will be treated as 1 minute, otherwise 0 (zero).

For usage examples and configuration options, please check the [Getting Started](https://gabor-boros.github.io/minutes/getting-started) and [Configuration](https://gabor-boros.github.io/minutes/configuration) documentation.
