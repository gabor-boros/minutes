Minutes is a CLI tool for synchronizing work logs between multiple time trackers, invoicing, and bookkeeping software to make entrepreneurs' daily work easier.  Every source and destination comes with their specific flags. Before using any flags, check the related documentation.

Minutes come with absolutely **NO WARRANTY**; before and after synchronizing any logs, please ensure you got the expected result.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Based on the nature of the project, prerequisites depending on what tools you are using. In case you are using Clockify as a time tracker and Tempo as your sync target, you should have an account at Clockify and Jira.

### Installation

To install `minutes`, use one of the [release artifacts](https://github.com/gabor-boros/minutes/releases). If you have `go` installed, you can simply run `go install https://github.com/gabor-boros/minutes` as well.

`minutes` has numerous flags and there will be more when other sources or targets are added. Therefore, `minutes` comes with a config file, that can be placed to the user's home directory or the config directory.

_To read more about the config file, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/minutes/tree/master/docs/README.md)_

### Usage examples

Depending on the config file, the number of flags can change.

#### Simplest command

```shell
# No arguments, no flags, just running the command
$ minutes
```

#### Set specific date and time

```shell
# Set the date and time to fetch entries in the given time frame
$ minutes --start "2021-10-07 00:00:00" --end "2021-10-07 23:59:59"
```

```shell
# Specify the start and end date format
$ minutes --date-format "2006-01-02" --start "2021-10-07" --end "2021-10-08"
```

#### Use tags for tasks

```shell
# Specify how a tag should look like to be considered as a task
$ minutes --tasks-as-tags --tasks-as-tags-regex '[A-Z]{2,7}-\d{1,6}'
```

#### Minute based rounding

```shell
# Set the billed and unbilled time separately
# to round to the closest minute (even if it is zero)
$ minutes --round-to-closest-minute
```

### Simple config file

```toml
# Source config
source = "clockify"
source-user = "<clockify user ID>"

clockify-url = "https://api.clockify.me"
clockify-api-key = "<clockify API token>"
clockify-workspace = "<clockify workspace ID>"

# Target config
target = "tempo"
target-user = "<jira username>"

tempo-url = "https://tasks.opencraft.com"
tempo-username = "<jira username>"
tempo-password = "<jira password>"

# General config
tasks-as-tags = true
tasks-as-tags-regex = '[A-Z]{2,7}-\d{1,6}'
round-to-closest-minute = true
force-billed-duration = true
```
